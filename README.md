This repository contains two different `.ipynb` notebooks:
1. The original [mcoletta_325_midterm.ipynb](mcoletta_325_midterm.ipynb) which analyzes the **warming temperatures in the United States** following the same guidelines and structure as the 325 midterm with different datasets.
2. [mcoletta_325_midterm_1.ipynb](mcoletta_325_midterm_1.ipynb) which analyzes **new voter registration**. This follows the original template with the original dataset and instructions, answering each of the proposed questions.
